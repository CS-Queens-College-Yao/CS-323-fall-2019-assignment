<b>(a)</b> For this problem I would adapt the Bellman-Ford Algorithm :heavy_check_mark:

<b>(b)</b> The time complexity for Bellman-Ford is O(VE) :heavy_check_mark:

<b>(c)</b> The genericShortest method is implementing dijkstra's algorithm :heavy_check_mark:

<b>(d)</b> 

<b>(e)</b> Dijkstra's algorithm is O(V+E)
